# Phoenix Web Framework Starter Kit for Gitpod

gitpod-elixir-phoenix is an optimized setup for https://gitpod.io workspace

### How-to:

- Register on https://gitpod.io
- Fork this repo
- Spin up your forked gitpod workspace: https://gitpod.io#https://github.com/[your-username]/gitpod-elixir-phoenix
- Follow the instructions in the cli to bootstrap your phoenix app

### How it works? 

This zero effort setup is an automated version of the official Phoneix Installation and Up and running guides:  
- https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/installation.html#content
- https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/up_and_running.html#content

It takes care about the installation of Erlang, Elxiir, Postgres and all the stuff you need to go through before finally you can have some fun with Phoneix.
